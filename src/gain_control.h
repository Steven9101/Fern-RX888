// The module's own gain control, what gain = auto means: the highest of the
// VGA's gain steps that keeps the LTC2208's 16-bit converter out of clipping
// with room to spare.
//
// A signal that keeps clipping is lost to every listener of the band, and
// the splatter of a converter driven past its limit lands all over the band,
// so a gain that keeps clipping comes down soon: a step once three tenths of
// a second in the last second clipped, 6 dB when those clipped heavily. A
// crash of static or a spark clips for a millisecond or so, which costs
// nobody much, while a gain lowered for it would cost the whole band its
// sensitivity for good: a tenth or two of a second that clip do not bring
// the gain down, and the gain still goes up past them. It goes up a step
// once nothing but such crashes has clipped for a while, and the peaks,
// all but the highest twentieth of them, would stay 6 dB under full scale
// one step higher. The while is 5 s in the first minutes, so that a band
// finds its gain soon after it starts, and a minute afterwards, so that a
// listener hears the level change rarely.
//
// The control only moves the VGA; module.attenuation stays where the
// operator set it.
